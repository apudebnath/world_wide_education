# World Wide Education

This project was bootstrapped with React app. Here I am trying to manage a learning site as much as easy way to show different course and course info to understand what services you can provide. This is site also live in Netlify: [https://world-wideedu-04oc21tob.netlify.app/]

## What is the main purpose of this website: 

>> AnyOne can easily manage this site with minimum effort and can show - won course or any types of e-learning meterials.

>> Attractive UI can attract targeted audiences and easy to use for your particepents.

>> This is a light waight and fast loading site because here we are using react and react router can easily load content without loading total page.




----------------------------------------------------------------------======================================================================

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
